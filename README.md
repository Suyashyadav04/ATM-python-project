Fully Functional ATM Interface
A Python-based ATM interface that simulates core functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). The program provides features such as user authentication, balance checking, depositing money, withdrawing money, and exiting the system. This is an educational project that demonstrates how a basic ATM system can be implemented.

Features
1. User Authentication
Secure login with a 4-digit PIN.
Allows 3 attempts before locking out the user.
2. Core ATM Functions
Check Balance: View your current account balance.
Deposit Money: Add funds to your account securely.
Withdraw Money: Withdraw cash if sufficient funds are available.
Exit: Safely end the session.
3. Data Handling
The program initializes with a default account balance.
Input validation to ensure safe and secure transactions.
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or later installed on your system.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/atm-interface.git
cd atm-interface
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python atm.py
Usage
Start the Program: Run the script to launch the ATM interface.

Login: Enter your 4-digit PIN (default is 1234) to authenticate. You have up to 3 attempts to log in.

Choose an Option:

1: Check your balance.
2: Deposit money by entering the desired amount.
3: Withdraw money, ensuring sufficient funds are available.
4: Exit the program.
Perform Transactions: Follow on-screen instructions to manage your account.

Future Enhancements
Add a database to store multiple user accounts and their transaction histories.
Implement advanced security features, such as encryption for PINs.
Integrate a graphical user interface (GUI) for better usability.
Add a feature to print transaction receipts or generate summaries.
